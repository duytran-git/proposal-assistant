## Transcript

**Jane:** Thank you for joining today. Can you tell me about your current challenges?

**John:** We're struggling with our proposal process. It takes too long and we lose deals because of it.

**Jane:** I understand. How many proposals does your team handle per month?

**John:** Around 50-60 proposals. Each one takes about 2-3 days to complete.

**Jane:** That's significant. Our solution could reduce that to hours instead of days.
